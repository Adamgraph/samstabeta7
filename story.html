<p>  
It started as an Idea on a Thursday, and on Saturday I started working on the JS Code.<br>Meanwhile I worked with CSS and picture creativity, also with the recording of the music.<br>On Sunday I created the spaceship and other optical images.<br>On Sunday evening I got the Idea for the name of the game "Samsta-Beta-7", which was my own mispronounce of "Some Star".<br>Music, Spaceship, Galaxyloop, all pictures and design are made by me.<br>I used on my Linux: Texteditor, Gimp, Audacity and an underrated Browser.
<br></p>
<p>The Music you hear is building up and spinning around...<br>...because the browser is starting 2 musicloops, which have different starts (about 0.8 seconds).<br>Both loops are nearly Clones of each other, thats why they are perfectly rebuilding.<br>I recorded the music sequence with my musicinstrument.<br><br>
Trouble with sound or Steering the Spaceship? Change in your Firefox Searchbar on the leftside of "https" the permission to "Allow Audio". Also possible in other Web-Browsers.
<br>Also play in Fullscreen (F11) if you have a small Computer Monitor.</p>
